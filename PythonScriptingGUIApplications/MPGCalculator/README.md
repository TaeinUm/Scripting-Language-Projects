# Miles Per Gallon Calculator
This directory hosts a Python GUI application designed to calculate the miles per gallon (MPG) for a vehicle.


## Features
- Calculate MPG by inputting miles driven and gallons of gas used.
- Clear inputs with a simple button click for a new calculation.


## Structure
- `ui.py`: Contains the user interface code, built with `Tkinter`, and the logic for MPG calculation.


## Getting Started
To operate the MPG Calculator, ensure Python is installed on your system. `Tkinter` is included with most Python installations. To run the application:

1. Clone the repository and change directory to `Problem3`.
2. Start the application using Python:

```bash
python3 ui.py
```

3. Enter the required information (miles driven and gallons of gas used) and use the interface to calculate the MPG.


## Dependencies
 - Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python)
