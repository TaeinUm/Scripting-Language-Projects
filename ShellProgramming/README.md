## Overview
This project emphasizes Bash scripting to solve various problems, including file manipulation, data processing, and implementing algorithms.




## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: `Bash`


## Project Details
### Moving Source Files
Move C source files to a backup directory while maintaining the directory structure. Ensure that the destination directory is created if it does not exist, and handle directories with more than three C files interactively.
- File: `prog1.sh`

### Column Sum Calculation
Compute the sum of each column in a data file and write the results to an output file. The data file contains numbers separated by commas, semicolons, or colons.
- File: `prog2.sh`

### Weighted Average Calculation
Calculate the weighted average of exam scores for each student, given a file with student IDs and scores, and a list of weights for each part of the exam.
- File: `prog3.sh`

### Assigning Letter Grades
Assign letter grades based on the percentage scores of students. The input is a directory containing score files, and the output is displayed in the console.
- File: `prog4.sh`

### Spell Checker for Four-Letter Words
Implement a spell checker that verifies the spelling of four-letter words in a text file against a dictionary of valid four-letter words.- File: `prog5.sh`


## Instruction
Here is an instruction for running the code.
Each folder contains the corresponding sh file and the relevant files to be used for testing.

- **/prog1**: The `/project` folder is the sample directory for testing.

- **/prog2**: `test.txt` is a test file for `prog2.sh`.

- **/prog3**: `data.txt` is a test file for `prog3.sh`.

- **/prog4**: The `/data` folder contains four test files for `prog4.sh`.

- **/prog5**: `dictionary.txt` is a sample of collection of four letter words which is considered to be "correct".
`sample.txt` is a sample text which contains incorrect words (typo).
