# Ruby Scripting
#### Taein Um




## Overview
This project emphasizes Ruby scripting to solve various problems, including extending existing classes, creating command-line utilities, implementing algorithms, and designing object-oriented systems.




## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: `Ruby`
- Libraries:
    - `optparse` (for command-line option parsing in Ruby Grep Utility)


## Project Details

### Extending Array Class
Extend the Array class to change the behavior of the `[]` and `map` methods. The `[]` method should return a default value instead of `nil` for out-of-bounds indices. The `map` method should accept an optional sequence argument to apply the block only to specified elements.
- File: `array.rb`

### Ruby Grep Utility
Create a grep-like utility in Ruby called `rgrep` that can search for patterns in a text file using various options such as word search, pattern search, and inverse match. The utility should support options for counting matches and extracting matched parts.
- File: `rgrep.rb`

### Virus Containment
Design an algorithm to quarantine infected areas in a binary grid by installing walls. The goal is to stop the spread of the virus by adding walls to contain it.
- File: `contains_virus.rb`

### Vehicle Class Hierarchy
Create a superclass `Vehicle` and subclasses `MyCar` and `MyTruck`. Implement instance variables, class variables, and methods for vehicle operations. Include a module `Towable` with a method to check towing capacity.
- File: `vehicle.rb`
